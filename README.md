This is the assembly code that performs "Cows and Bulls".
Among the "Cows and Bulls", the code only performs the logic on the low.

```
Ball when the number is correct but only the position is wrong
b. Strike when both numbers and positions are correct
c. Out when both numbers and positions are incorrect
```
